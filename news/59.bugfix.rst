3.0.1 (2023-03-04)
------------------
Bug fixes:

- Type error is removed and none is returned.
  In this modified version of the code, if no primary field adapter is found, the fieldname and field attributes are set to None. The value property checks whether the field attribute is None, and returns None if it is, instead of raising an error.
